To install required packages. Run : 

pip install -r requirements.txt 
-
and install the .zip file inside libs folder.
-
pip install full/path/libs/tweet-preprocessor-0.4.0.zip

Or, simply run the .bat file for Windows.(Tested and working!). Others are unstable and not working, better to do that manually.

NOTE : 
Please make sure that you have a clean environment. Sometimes, anaconda will have preinstalled libraries that will cause collisions, please remove all preinstalled libraries if any problems occur during installation!
